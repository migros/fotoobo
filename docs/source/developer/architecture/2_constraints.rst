The FortiXYZ-APIs
-----------------

Not all functionality that fotoobo offers or likes to offer is possible with the use of the
documented API of the respective FortiXYZ product. Sometimes there is a possibility to use
undocumented API calls learned by debugging the official web interface of the respective product.
But these cases are risky because Fortinet does not necessarily keep backwards compatibility for
these API calls and will also not document any changes.
Other times we can not overcome the limitations and need to use other ways to get the required
information (SNMP, ...).
